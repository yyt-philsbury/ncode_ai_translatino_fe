            About Our Service

          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            Use ChatGPT to translate Japanese web novels from ncode.syosetu. AI
            does a surprisingly good job of producing understandable text -
            unlike typical ML translation.

            Why Use Us?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            You can always create a ChatGPT account and manually copy-paste
            text, but it's a pain in the ass for the following reasons (trust me
            I tried):
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            1) There's no auto saving of translated chapters so it takes a lot
            of copy pasting and self organizing to read the chapters again
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            2) ChatGPT has a max token limit so for really long chapters you
            have to break it down yourself
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            3) Unless you pay an additional $20.00 USD / month ChatGPT isn't
            always available
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            4) You have to self track bookmarks and ncode URLs which is much
            harder to do due to language barrier
          </Typography>
        </Box>
        <Box sx={{ my: 4 }}>

            What do I need?
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            You need a ChatGPT account (free to create) and an API key. You will
            be charged for API usage but it's pretty cheap. As of 5/25/2023, the
            cost of using the 3.5-turbo model is $0.002 / 1K tokens prompt and
            response. The cost of one translated chapter comes out to about
            $0.02 USD for 3000 words input and 3000 words output.
